# Flappy-bird-game
The Flappy Bird Game with GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game. This version provides an engaging visual experience, complete with interactive elements and user-friendly controls.


In this project, we will create the flappy bird game with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library.

Throughout the project, we will create the game loop, create a jframe and jpanel, draw images on the jpanel, add click handlers to make the flappy bird jump, randomly generate pipes and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the flappy bird and each pipe, and add a running score.
